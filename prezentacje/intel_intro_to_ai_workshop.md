# Intro
Intel trainings are design as tools to help you sell and it sometimes leads to trainings that are:
- mostly inside oriented  
- lacks technology context  

>It works well for well known established products, but is not ideals for less known topics (eg. optane misunderstanding (what memory means))

We try to fill tech and external point-of -view gap.
This presentation is purely technology primer. Most topics are non controversial, but represent ecosystem view. I show how 'everyone' look at AI and won't argue Intel case.

# General Artificial Intelligence
There is plenty of opinions on Artificial Intelligence, and many flavours of it. The main topic being narrow vs general AI.
Narrow AI is a system capable of solving specific problem (recognizing cats, predicting stock prices, translating speach), while general AI is our proverbial Terminator or HAL of 2001 Space Oddyssey. 
We are suprisingly good at narrow AI, but have no clue as to how to build general AI and how far from it we are now.
Focus of the presentation is narrow AI.

# Cats, killer robots and non-organic life 
There are 3 topics that have to be mentioned in he context of AI:
- cats
- killer robots
- one of three: general AI, singularity, non-organic intelligent life

The presentation focus is  purerly on cats, but I have very strong opinions on other two, so feel free to ask.
